          Hi there, Thank you for reading my learning log for the first quarter
          of 2023. I am going to share what I have learned in the last three
          months. I hope you will find it useful.

          <div class="blog-tldr-heading">TL;DR</div>
          <div>
            I learned Rust, Data Science, maintaining bfportal.gg and
            contributing to django, is-a-dev and community tools.

            At the start of the year, I decided that I will be learning Rust.
            For, the next month I was learning the basics of Rust. The borrow
            checker in rust was a new concept for me. The last static language
            that I used was C++ and I was not familiar with the concept of
            ownership. I was able to learn the basics of Rust in a month. I was
            able to build a simple CLI application in Rust. Currently, I am in
            the last chapter of the book about building a web server in Rust.

          <div class="blog-log-heading month">February</div>
          <div class="blog-log-content">
            Then as January came to a close, I was very interested in ChatGPT.
            The more I looked into it, the more I got interested in data science
            and machine learning. I spent most of my time completing the course
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/" target="_blank"
              >"Deep Learning A-Z‚Ñ¢ 2023: Neural Networks"</a
            >
            on udemy. I learned concepts like ANN, CNN, and Boltzmann Machine.
            During this time I also played with
            <b>Wagtail API for <a href="https://bfportal.gg/">bfportal.gg</a></b
            >. I wanted to expose the creator of an experience in the API. But
            as the creator is a nested user field it can't be in the API as a
            field of its own. So I made use of
            <a
              href="https://github.com/battlefield-portal-community/bfportal.gg/commit/25f7965a74df0f067caca8e632947a03b303ec79"
              target="_blank"
              >`@property`</a
            >
            so that a function can resolve the nested property into a single
            value. Then google shared accepted GSOC orgs with us. I am excited
            as both Wagtail and Django got selected.

          <div class="blog-log-content">
            <img src="../static/images/ll-perf.png" class="rounded" />
            <br>
            Then came march and I wanted to get selected as a GSOC contributor
            this year. I started <b style="color: pink;">contributing to Django</b> and got my <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/16538" target="_blank">first PR</a> in
            the project approved and merged üòÅ . During this month bfportal had
            two major events.<br><br> Its userbase crossed 2k users <br> Migrating the
            project to use Python 3.11.<br><br> I was also using `runserver` in
            production but now the project uses `gunicorn`. That gave the
            project a very very good performance boost (I've attached the usage
            graph). Currently, I'm preparing for my Maths exam (is on the 28th
            of march) and drafting my proposal for GSOC.
